# Functional PHP

The project is born out of constant frustration with certain communities and 
their quips that they have functional features, or that there is some new
library that solves all of their problems by doing something `functional`.  The
PHP community seems especially prone to this sort of misinformation, which is 
why this project targets that taudry language.

In being reminded of the overwhelming interest in `the functional style`,
I decided to create something as close as a functional DSL in PHP as 
possible.  This is a bit limited, as PHP does not really have the 
ability to support new syntax, so this exercise stops with abstract
syntax.  The objective is to concisely show what the closest thing to
functional might be using PHP. 

Take a moment to see how that is done.  There is what you might call a 
two-minute linked list class, meaning that it took all of two minutes or
less to code up, and a few functions that gives it a nudge in the 
direction of looking like function evaluation rather than objects.  The 
normal cadre of basic list functions are implemented, including `map`
in tail-recursive form.  Please take this code and spread it to the wind,
help educate people on what functional programming actually is, and have
fun with it.

There you have it, now you can say you actually saw something functional
in PHP.  Facilitated by writing a new abstract syntax DSL in PHP.  So
it isn't really PHP, it is a new mini-language that is LISP-like.  Please take
this code and spread it to the wind, help educate people about what is 
special about functional programming and what it really is, and have fun
with it.  You might find the [notes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IEFzjppa1-UlqauOotJmVs2B4lT5xVit4Ziwq3v8zPQ/pub)
